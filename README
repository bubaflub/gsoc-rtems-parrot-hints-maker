Parrot on RTEMS - Parrot compiler hints maker

For Google Summer of Code 2010
Bob Kuo

This Makefile will pull all the needed information from an installed RTEMS system and generate:

  * a Parrot hints file (named after your target CPU and BSP, e.g. "sparc_sis.pm") 
  * a "parrot_rtems_config_directives" file which contains all the directives for Parrot's Configure.pl script.

USAGE

1) Copy your Parrot hints file into the Parrot source under config/init/hints/.
2) At the top of the Parrot source directory, run:

  perl Configure.pl --file=/path/to/parrot_rtems_config_directives

Replacing /path/to/ with the actual path.
