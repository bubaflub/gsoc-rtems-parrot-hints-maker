* get parrot executable to load on qemu and run in i386-rtems4.10-gdb
* finish bootstrapping instead of just building miniparrot
* have main.c load dynops
* load and run parrot test suite into qemu

In no particular order:

* switch to use perl instead of make and makefiles
* have complete automated build process
* setup separate virtual box image for RTEMS
* patch parrot to allow out of directory building
